**Project Title**
Fraud Detection in Online Transactions

**Description**
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in online transactions. The dataset contains information about each transaction, including the type, amount, involved parties, and whether it is a fraudulent transaction or not.

**Dataset**
The dataset includes the following columns:

step: Represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour.
type: Type of online transaction.
amount: The amount of the transaction.
nameOrig: Customer starting the transaction.
oldbalanceOrg: Balance before the transaction for the originating account.
newbalanceOrig: Balance after the transaction for the originating account.
nameDest: Recipient of the transaction.
oldbalanceDest: Initial balance of the recipient before the transaction.
newbalanceDest: The new balance of the recipient after the transaction.
isFraud: Indicates whether the transaction is a fraud or not.

**Project Structure**

1. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
Handle missing values.
Check for outliers.
Explore the distribution of each feature.
Analyze the distribution of fraudulent transactions.
2. Feature Engineering:
Create new features if necessary.
Encode categorical variables.
3. Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to better understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (isFraud).
4. Model Building:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Choose a suitable machine learning model for fraud detection (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.).
Train the model on the training set.
5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics (precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).
6. Conclusion:
Summarize the findings from your analysis.
Discuss the effectiveness of the model in detecting fraudulent transactions.
