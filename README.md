Project Title
Loan Approval Prediction and Model Comparison

Description
This project aims to predict the approval of personal loans using various machine learning models. The dataset includes information about customers, such as age, experience, income, ZIP code, family size, credit card average score, education, mortgage amount, and the approval status of a personal loan.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

ID: Unique ID of each customer.
Age: Customer Age.
Experience: Customer Experience.
Income: Customer Income.
ZIP Code: Customer Address Zipcode.
Family: Number of Family Members.
CCAvg: Credit Card Average Score.
Education: Customer Education.
Mortgage: Mortgage Amount.
Personal Loan: Binary variable indicating loan approval (0 = Not Approved, 1 = Approved).

**Project Structure**

1. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
Handle missing values.
Check for outliers.
Explore the distribution of each feature.
2. Feature Engineering:
Create new features if necessary.
Encode categorical variables.
3. Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to better understand the relationships between different features and the target variable Personal Loan.
4. Model Building:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Choose a suitable machine learning model for loan approval prediction (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.).
Train the model on the training set.
5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics (precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).
6. Conclusion:
Summarize the findings from your analysis.
Discuss the effectiveness of the model in predicting personal loan approval.
